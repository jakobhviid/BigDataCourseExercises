# Lecture 03 - Distributed Transport and Streaming

## Exercises

The exercises for this week's lecture is be about distributed transport and streaming. You will be creating a Kafka
cluster and various publishing programs and subscribing programs to stream records.
The focus of today's lecture is to interact with Kafka, create Python producer and consumer programs, and configure
Kafka registry and Kafka connect modules. Furthermore, we introduce exercises to Sqoop and Flume.

Please open issues [here](https://github.com/jakobhviid/BigDataCourseExercises/issues) if you encounter unclear
information or experience bugs in our examples!

### Exercise 1 - Deploy a Kafka cluster

The objective of this exercise is to deploy a Kafka cluster. This year will be using a helm chart
from [Bitnami](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/kafka#bitnami-package-for-apache-kafka) to deploy a Kafka
cluster.

**Task**: Deploy Kafka using the `helm` and the following [kafka-values.yaml](kafka-values.yaml) file.

```bash
helm install --values kafka-values.yaml kafka oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/kafka --version 30.0.4
```

**Notice**: When you need to delete the Kafka cluster, you can use the following command: `helm delete kafka`.

#### Validate the deployment of Kafka using a simple producer and consumer

**Tasks**: Producing and consuming topic messages

1. Create a Kafka client pod (`docker.io/bitnami/kafka:3.8.0-debian-12-r3`) using `kubectl run`.

```bash
kubectl run kafka-client --restart='Never' --image docker.io/bitnami/kafka:3.8.0-debian-12-r3  --command -- sleep infinity
```

2. Open two terminals and attach to the Kafka client pod using `kubectl exec` command.

```bash
kubectl exec --tty -i kafka-client -- bash
```

3. Run the following commands in the first terminal to produce messages to the Kafka topic `test`:

```bash
kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic test
```

4. Run the following commands in the second terminal to consume messages from the Kafka topic `test`:

```bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic test --from-beginning
```

5. Try typing text in the first terminal and hit enter. What happens in the second terminal?

**Task**: Delete the pod you just created (`kafka-client`).

<details>
  <summary><strong>Hint</strong>: Delete the pod</summary>

CTRL + C should exit the terminal and delete the pod. If not then just use the commands below.

  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod/kafka-client
  ```

</details>

### Exercise 2 - Additional deployments of Kafka Connect, Kafka Schema Registry, and Kafka KSQL

We will also use Kafka Connect, Kafka Schema Registry, and Kafka KSQL to facilitate a distributed transport and
streaming of records in Kafka. These services are included in the given in the manifest files:

- [kafka-schema-registry.yaml](./kafka-schema-registry.yaml)
- [kafka-connect.yaml](./kafka-connect.yaml)
- [kafka-ksqldb.yaml](./kafka-ksqldb.yaml)

**Task**: Familiarize yourself with the three mentioned files.
**Task**: Create additional deployments of Kafka Connect, Kafka Schema Registry, and Kafka KSQL using the following
commands:

1. Apply the Kafka Schema Registry manifest file to your namespace. `kubectl apply -f kafka-schema-registry.yaml`
1. Apply the Kafka Connect module to your namespace. `kubectl apply -f kafka-connect.yaml`
1. Apply the Kafka Ksqldb server to your namespace. `kubectl apply -f kafka-ksqldb.yaml`
1. Toggle the following values in the redpanda config map ([redpanda.yaml](./redpanda.yaml)) to enable Kafka modules.
    - `KAFKA_SCHEMAREGISTRY_ENABLED`=`true`
    - `CONNECT_ENABLED`=`true`

The list below summarises the extra services and briefly demonstrate how to interact with them:

- Registry (kafka-schema-registry)
    - `kubectl port-forward svc/kafka-schema-registry 8081`. Make a `curl` cmd in a terminal using the
      URL [http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081) and get this output:

      ```bash
      curl http://127.0.0.1:8081
      {}%                                  
      ```

- Connect (kafka-connect)
    - `kubectl port-forward svc/kafka-connect 8083`. Make a `curl` cmd in a terminal using the
      URL [http://127.0.0.1:8083](http://127.0.0.1:8083) and get this output:

      ```bash
      curl http://127.0.0.1:8083
      {"version":"7.3.1-ce","commit":"a453cbd27246f7bb","kafka_cluster_id":"<kafka_cluster_id>"}%                                    
      ```

- KsqlDB (kafka-ksqldb-server) and KsqlDB CLI (kafka-ksqldb-cli)
    - `kubectl exec --stdin --tty deployment/kafka-ksqldb-cli -- ksql http://kafka-ksqldb-server:8088` make sure you
      will reach a console similar to this:

      ```bash
                        
                        ===========================================

### Exercise 3 - The Redpanda console

We will use the [Redpanda Console](https://redpanda.com/redpanda-console-kafka-ui) to interact with Kafka. The console
is a web-based user interface that allows you to interact with Kafka topics, schema registry, and Kafka connectors.

**Task**: Deploy Redpanda using manifest file [redpanda.yaml](./redpanda.yaml) with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f redpanda.yaml
```

**Task**: Access Redpanda using the following command: `kubectl port-forward svc/redpanda 8080` to
open [Redpanda](http://127.0.0.1:8080) in your browser!

**Task**: Explore the following tabs:

- [Overview](http://127.0.0.1:8080/overview)
- [Topics](http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics)
- [Schema Registry](http://127.0.0.1:8080/schema-registry)
- [Kafka Connectors](http://127.0.0.1:8080/connect-clusters/Connectors)

**Task**: Question: What does the [Topics](http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics) view show you?

**Task**: Manual interaction with Kafka using the Redpanda UI:

1. Use Redpanda to create a topic called `test-redpanda`.
1. Use Redpanda to produce record with `key=1` and `value={"id":1,"status":"it works"}` to the created topic
   `test-redpanda`.
1. Use Redpanda to delete all the messages in topic `test-redpanda`.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Hint</strong>: Step by step.</summary>

1. A new topic can be generated by clicking on the "Create topic" button inside
   the [Topics](http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics) view.
1. Select the topic `test-redpanda` and find the button "Produce Record" inside the newly generated topic
   `test-redpanda`: [topics/test-redpanda](http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics/test-redpanda). Add the key value in the data
   field under "key" and add the json message into the data field under "value". Press "Produce" to complete.
1. Find the button "Delete Records" inside the newly generated topic
   `test-redpanda`: [topics/test-redpanda](http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics/test-redpanda). Select "All Partitions" ->
   press "Choose End Offset" -> select "High Watermark" -> press "Delete Records" -> done.

</details>

### Exercise 4 - Produce messages to Kafka using Python

The objective of this exercise is to create a program which publishes records to a Kafka topic. The exercise builds on
top of [exercise 8 from lecture 2](../02/README.md#exercise-10---create-six-fictive-data-sources), but instead of saving
the data to HDFS we will publish it to a Kafka topic and use a Kafka Connector to save the records to HDFS.
This exercise focuses on creating the topic and creating the producer. If you have not solved the exercise from last
week then you can use the files provided [here](./hints/simple-producer.py).

**Tasks**: Think about what properties you want for the `INGESTION` topic:

- How many partitions will you have for the `INGESTION` topic?
- Which replication factor will you use for the `INGESTION` topic?
- Which min in-sync replicas will you use for the `INGESTION` topic?
- What would be an appropriate retention time for the `INGESTION` topic?
- What would be an appropriate retention size for the `INGESTION` topic?

**Task**: Create the `INGESTION` topic with your chosen properties.

**Hint**: Use Redpanda (ref. [exercise 02](README.md#exercise-3---the-redpanda-console)).

**Task**: Question: Which property will be possible if you add a key, which defines the sensor id, to each record?

**Task**: Update your program from [lecture 2 exercise 8](../02/README.md#exercise-10---create-six-fictive-data-sources)
to produce sensor samples directly to Kafka.

**Hint**: If you did not create a program then use the scripts [./hints/*.py](./hints).

**Task**: Now that you have created the producer program it is time to run it.

**Notice**: We recommend to use an interactive container and attach to it
using [vscode](../../services/interactive/README.md#attach-visual-studio-code-to-a-running-container) as we did last
time in lecture 2.

**Verification**: To verify that the program is producing messages to the `INGESTION` topic. Open Redpanda
console: [localhost:8080/topics/INGESTION](http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics/INGESTION?p=-1&s=50&o=-1#messages).

<details>
  <summary><strong>Hints</strong>: The creation of the Python producer</summary>

1. Install Python inside the interactive container using `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python -y`
2. Copy the provided solution to the interactive container
    - [client.py](./hints/client.py)
    - [data_model.py](./hints/data_model.py)
    - [simple-producer.py](./hints/simple-producer.py)
3. Run the program using `python simple-producer.py`

Open [localhost:8080/topics/INGESTION](http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics/INGESTION#messages) in your browser and look for the
number of messages.

</details>

### Exercise 5 - Consume messages from Kafka using Python with single and multiple consumers

The objective of this exercise is to write a Python consumer and to output the messages from the `INGESTION` topic.

A requirement for the program is that it must take a consumer `group_id` as an argument. It can either be an environment
variable, a config file, or an argument to the program when you run it.

**Task**: Create a consumer program and run it in the terminal in your interactive container.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint</strong>: A consumer program.</summary>

The below-mentioned files provide one solution for exercise.

- [hints/client.py](./hints/client.py)
- [hints/data_model.py](./hints/data_model.py) (not used but is still required because it is imported by
  `hints/client.py`)
- [hints/simple-consumer.py](./hints/simple-consumer.py)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Verify</strong>: A consumer program</summary>

Run the program using `python simple-consumer.py`

The following should be printed to the console:

```bash
group_id=DEFAULT_CONSUMER
PackageObj(payload=SensorObj(sensor_id=3, modality=421, unit='MW', temporal_aspect='real_time'), correlation_id='906f764e-0f3b-4517-aed7-3b646081f6fb', created_at=1694902173.122458, schema_version=1)
...
...
...
```

</details>

**Task**: Start another consumer but with a different group id in your interactive container. What happens when you run
the program?

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint</strong>: Another consumer</summary>

Run the program using `python simple-consumer.py <GROUP_ID>`

The following should be printed to the console:

```bash
group_id=<GROUP_ID>
PackageObj(payload=SensorObj(sensor_id=3, modality=421, unit='MW', temporal_aspect='real_time'), correlation_id='906f764e-0f3b-4517-aed7-3b646081f6fb', created_at=1694902173.122458, schema_version=1)
...
...
...
```

</details>

**Task**: Open [localhost:8080/topics/INGESTION](http://127.0.0.1:8080/topics/INGESTION#consumers). You should now see a
table similar to the one below. What does the Lag column mean?

```bash
Group               Lag
<GROUP_ID>          3182
DEFAULT_CONSUMER    3186
```

**Task**: Questions:

- How can we get two consumers to receive identical records?
- How can we get two consumers to receive unique records?
- What defines the maximum number of active parallel consumers within one consumer group?

### Exercise 6 - Kafka Ksql

The objective of this exercise is use ksqlDB to split the records in the `INGESTION` topic into six separate streams
`SENSOR_ID_{1, 2, ..., 6}` based on the sensor id in the `payload` field of the JSON file.

#### Useful ksqlDB commands

- `SHOW TOPICS;`
- `PRINT <topic> FROM BEGINNING;`
- `SHOW STREAMS;`
- `CREATE STREAM ...`

**Task**: Get interactive shell with ksqlDB.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Hint</strong>: kubectl exec</summary>

  ```
  kubectl exec --stdin --tty deployment/kafka-ksqldb-cli -- ksql http://kafka-ksqldb-server:8088
  ```

</details>


**Task**: Create a stream over the existing `INGESTION` topic with the following name `STREAM_INGESTION`.


<details>
<summary><strong>Hint</strong>:ksqlDB CREATE STREAM on topic</summary>

```sql
CREATE
STREAM STREAM_INGESTION (
  payload STRING,
  correlation_id STRING,
  created_at DOUBLE,
  schema_version INTEGER
) WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC = 'INGESTION', VALUE_FORMAT = 'JSON');
```

</details>

**Task**: Create a new stream based on previously created stream `STREAM_INGESTION`. Start by writing a SQL statement
which filters the records with the sensor of interest. Then populate the records into a new stream
`SENSOR_ID_<sensor_id>`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint</strong>: ksqlDB CREATE STREAM from SELECT</summary>

```sql
CREATE
STREAM SENSOR_ID_<sensor_id> AS
SELECT *
FROM STREAM_INGESTION
WHERE EXTRACTJSONFIELD(PAYLOAD, '$.sensor_id') = '<sensor_id>';
```

</details>

**Task**: Validate your newly created streams using ksql commands in its CLI.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint</strong>: ksqlDB SELECT STREAM with EMIT CHANGES</summary>

```sql
SELECT *
FROM SENSOR_ID_<sensor_id> EMIT CHANGES;
```

The `EMIT CHANGES` clause makes the query a continuous query, meaning it will keep listening for new events as they
arrive

</details>

### Exercise 7 - Kafka Connect and HDFS

The objective of this exercise is apply and configure a Kafka Connect module to write the records from the `INGESTION`
topic into HDFS as mentioned
in [exercise 03](README.md#exercise-2---additional-deployments-of-kafka-connect-kafka-schema-registry-and-kafka-ksql).

The module of interest is
the [HDFS 2 Sink Connector](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-connectors/hdfs/current/overview.html) created by a company
called Confluent. The module will be accessible through the ready-running `kafka-connect` service. The creation of the
underlying image of our `kafka-connect` service can be further explored
here: [README.md](../../services/kafka-connect/README.md).

***NB***: This connector module will work with our installation of HDFS despite the various version numbers. This module
is under the [Confluent Community License v1.0](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license/) which enables
free use.

**Task**: Ensure you have HDFS running as in lecture 2.

**Task**: Setup HDFS 2 Sink Connector in our `kafka-connect` service.
**Notice**: The Redpanda UI does not include all the necessary properties for the configuration of the HDFS 2 Sink
Connector. Therefore, you need to investigate how to interact with
the [Connect REST Interface](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/references/restapi.html). Then you need
to post the configuration using `curl` in a terminal with port-forwarding enabled or using an interactive container in
Kubernetes.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint</strong>:Post the configuration using `curl`</summary>

This example will be using port-forwarding. Therefore, ensure `kubectl port-forward svc/kafka-connect 8083` has been
enabled.

Look into the configuration in the chunk below and the command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST \
http://127.0.0.1:8083/connectors \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "name": "hdfs-sink",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.hdfs.HdfsSinkConnector",
        "tasks.max": "3",
        "topics": "INGESTION",
        "hdfs.url": "hdfs://namenode:9000",
        "flush.size": "3",
        "format.class": "io.confluent.connect.hdfs.json.JsonFormat",
        "key.converter.schemas.enable":"false",
        "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
        "key.converter.schema.registry.url": "http://kafka-schema-registry:8081", 
        "value.converter.schemas.enable":"false",
        "value.converter.schema.registry.url": "http://kafka-schema-registry:8081", 
        "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"
    }
}'
```

**Note:** If this does not work for you (Windows), then you can use this command (using Command Prompt NOT Powershell):

````bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @hints/configuration.json http://127.0.0.1:8083/connectors
````

</details>


**Task**: Validate the HDFS 2 Sink Connector is working as expected.

- Make sure the following folders in HDFS have been created: `/topics` and `/logs`.

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Hint</strong>:Post the configuration using curl</summary>

    - Open and interactive terminal like `kubectl run hdfs-cli -i --tty --image apache/hadoop:3 -- bash`.
    - `hdfs dfs -fs hdfs://namenode:8020 -ls /topics/` -> /topics/INGESTION
  </details>

- Use Redpanda UI to find the total lag (difference between log ned offset and group offset) of the consumer group
  `connect-hdfs-sink` [localhost:8080/groups/connect-hdfs-sink](http://127.0.0.1:8080/groups/connect-hdfs-sink).
    - How does HDFS 2 Sink Connector keep up with the six fictive data sources?

### Exercise 8 - Flume

The objective of this exercise is to ingest data from a command-line program into Kafka using Flume. This exercise will
simulate a scenario where an endpoint continuously provides new data that can be ingested using Flume.

**Task**: Deploy the Flume manifest [flume.yaml](flume.yaml).

**Task**: Open an interactive container with Python 3.12 or use the interactive pod provided.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint</strong>: kubectl run</summary>

```bash
kubectl run python -i --tty --image python:3.12 -- bash
```

</details>

**Task**: Create a command-line program which simulates new inputs from the command-line. Run the program in your
interactive container.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint</strong>: A text input program.</summary>

The below-mentioned file provide one solution for exercise.

- [text_input.py](./hints/text_input.py)

  </details>

**Task**: Open [localhost:8080/topics/flume-logs](http://localhost:8080/topics/flume-logs). You should now see the
streamed data from the command-line into a kafka topic.

**Optional task**: Set up a new HDFS 2 Sink Connector to ingest the data into HDFS from the `flume-logs` Kafka topic.

### Exercise 9 - Sqoop

The objective of this exercise is to ingest a database table into HDFS utilizing Sqoop.

#### Useful Sqoop commands

- `sqoop list-databases --connect "jdbc:<DB_DRIVER>://<DB_URL>/<DB_TABLE>"`
- `sqoop import --connect "jdbc:<DB_DRIVER>://<DB_URL>/<DB_TABLE>"`

**Task**: Deploy PostgresSQL database using Helm Chart with the following command:

```bash
helm install postgresql \
  --version=12.1.5 \
  --set auth.username=root \
  --set auth.password=pwd1234 \
  --set auth.database=employees \
  --set primary.extendedConfiguration="password_encryption=md5" \
  --repo https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami \
  postgresql
```

**Task**: Get interactive shell with PostgresSQL.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Hint</strong>: kubectl exec</summary>

  ```
  kubectl exec -it postgresql-0  -- bash
  ```

</details>

**Task**: Seed the database with employees.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Hint</strong>: Create a new table with employees</summary>

- Login to the database

  ```bash
  PGPASSWORD=pwd1234 psql -U root -d employees
  ```

- Seed the database with employees

  ```
  CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
  );
  
  INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary) VALUES
  ('John Doe', 'Engineering', 75000),
  ('Jane Smith', 'Marketing', 65000),
  ('Alice Johnson', 'HR', 60000),
  ('Robert Brown', 'Finance', 80000);
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Verify</strong>: Check employees were added</summary>

  ```bash
  SELECT * FROM employees;
  ```

Expected output

  ```
    id |     name      | department  |  salary
  ----+---------------+-------------+----------
    1 | John Doe      | Engineering | 75000.00
    2 | Jane Smith    | Marketing   | 65000.00
    3 | Alice Johnson | HR          | 60000.00
    4 | Robert Brown  | Finance     | 80000.00
  (4 rows)
  ```

</details>

Now the database have been seeded with employees and now be ingested with Apache Sqoop

**Task**: Deploy the Sqoop manifest [sqoop.yaml](sqoop.yaml).

**Task**: Get interactive shell with Sqoop.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Hint</strong>: kubectl exec</summary>

  ```
  kubectl exec -it sqoop-<ID> -- bash
  ```

</details>

**Task**: Verify that Sqoop can connect to the PostgresSQL database

<details>
  <summary><strong>Hint</strong>: List databases with Sqoop</summary>

  ```bash
  sqoop list-databases \
    --connect "jdbc:postgresql://postgresql:5432/employees" \
    --username root \
    --password pwd1234 
  ```

</details>

**Task**: Ingest the database into HDFS

<details>
  <summary><strong>Hint</strong>: Use Sqoop to import database</summary>

  ```bash
  sqoop import \
  --connect "jdbc:postgresql://postgresql:5432/employees" \
  --username root \
  --password pwd1234 \
  --table employees \
  --target-dir /employees \
  --direct \
  --m 1
  ```

</details>

**Task**: Verify that the PostgresSQL table `employees` were ingested into HDFS.

**Validate**: Make sure a directory `/employees` were added to HDFS.

## Step-by-step guide to clean up

You will be using HDFS, Kafka, and the interactive container in next lecture. However, if you will clean up the
resources created in this lecture, you can follow the steps below:

### Automated clean up

If you have Python installed on your machine, you can use the following command to clean up all resources:

**Windows**:

````bash
python cleanup.py
````

**MacOS / Linux**:

````bash
python3 cleanup.py
````

The script will delete all resources created in the exercises.

### Manual clean up

- Today's exercises.
    1. `kubectl delete -f sqoop.yaml`
    1. `helm delete postgresql`
    1. `kubectl delete pvc data-postgresql-0`
    1. `kubectl delete pod python`
    1. `kubectl delete -f flume.yaml`
    1. `kubectl delete pod kafka-client`
    1. `kubectl delete -f redpanda.yaml`
    1. `kubectl delete -f kafka-schema-registry.yaml`
    1. `kubectl delete -f kafka-connect.yaml`
    1. `kubectl delete -f kafka-ksqldb.yaml`
    1. `helm delete kafka`
- cd into the `services/interactive` folder in the repository.
    1. `kubectl delete -f interactive.yaml`
- cd into the `services/hdfs` folder in the repository.
    1. `kubectl delete -f hdfs-cli.yaml` (if used)
    1. `kubectl delete -f datanodes.yaml`
    1. `kubectl delete -f namenode.yaml`
    1. `kubectl delete -f configmap.yaml`

You can get a list of the pods and services to verify that they are deleted.

- `kubectl get all`
